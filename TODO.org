* Razor File Manager - Project TODO

** Design Philosophies

*** LLM Commandments
Rules that all LLMs should follow when working on this codebase:

1. *Always review Gio documentation before making assumptions about UI behavior*
   - Gio has specific patterns for event handling, layout, and rendering
   - Check https://gioui.org/doc/architecture for architectural patterns
   - Check https://pkg.go.dev/gioui.org for API documentation
   - Never assume how events propagate - verify with documentation

2. *Test incrementally with debug output*
   - When fixing UI issues, add debug statements to understand the problem
   - Verify assumptions with actual runtime output before proceeding

3. *Prefer Gio's built-in patterns over custom implementations*
   - Use widget.Clickable for click handling
   - Use event.Op and pointer.Filter for custom event handling
   - Avoid complex manual hit-testing when Gio's event system can handle it

4. *Understand Gio's immediate mode rendering*
   - Layout happens every frame
   - Event registration in frame N delivers events in frame N+1
   - State must be stored in the Renderer struct between frames

** Current Priorities
