* Razor File Explorer Implementation Strategy

** Core Architecture & Philosophy
   - [ ] *Event Driven Architecture*: 
     - Use unbuffered or buffered channels for all File I/O.
     - Ensure the UI thread (Main Goroutine) never waits on a blocking operation.
     - Implement a central event loop that `select`s on UI events and Data channels.
   - [ ] *Performance First*: 
     - Usage of `github.com/charlievieth/fastwalk` for rapid directory enumeration.
     - Zero-allocation logic where possible in hot paths (rendering loops).
   - [ ] *Project Structure*:
     - Use `internal/` to encapsulate core logic and prevent external imports of private APIs.
     - maintain strict separation of concerns to avoid circular dependencies.
     - Example: `cmd/razor` (entry), `internal/ui` (widgets), `internal/fs` (file ops).
   - [ ] *Code Efficiency*:
     - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.
     - Avoid verbose boilerplate; prefer composition over deep inheritance or complex constructors.
     - Minimal use of compiler directives (build tags) only when OS-specific syscalls are absolutely required.

** Phase 1: Core Skeleton & Event Loop
   - [ ] Initialize Go Workspace and Modules.
   - [ ] Setup `internal/ui` package for Gio-specific code.
   - [ ] Setup `internal/fs` package for `fastwalk` integration.
   - [ ] Implement the main Event Loop (Channel Select Pattern).
   - [ ] Verify `fastwalk` runs in a separate goroutine and pipes data back to UI.

** Phase 2: Navigation & State Management
   - [ ] Create `AppState` struct to hold `CurrentPath`, `History`, and `Selection`.
   - [ ] Implement `Breadcrumbs` widget for path navigation.
   - [ ] Implement History Stack (Back/Forward functionality).
   - [ ] *OS Handling*: 
     - [ ] Windows Drive enumeration (C:\, D:\).
     - [ ] Unix/Linux Root (/).

** Phase 3: High-Performance UI Rendering
   - [ ] Implement Virtualization for the File List (`layout.List`).
     - Ensure only visible items are processed/rendered.
   - [ ] Efficient Icon Rendering (Cache commonly used icons).
   - [ ] Mouse/Keyboard Interaction:
     - [ ] Single click to select.
     - [ ] Double click to traverse/open.
     - [ ] Keyboard navigation (Arrow keys).

** Phase 4: Advanced Features
   - [ ] *Search*: 
     - Multi-threaded recursive search using `fastwalk`.
     - Real-time filtering of the displayed list.
   - [ ] *Async Metadata*: 
     - Calculate directory sizes on a background thread (Right-click -> Properties).
   - [ ] *Preview Pane*: 
     - Light-weight text/image preview for selected files.

** Phase 5: Optimization & Hardening
   - [ ] *Profiling*: Use `pprof` to identify memory leaks during heavy walks (100k+ files).
   - [ ] *Context Cancellation*: Ensure walkers are cancelled immediately when the user switches directories.
   - [ ] *Cross-Platform Checks*: Verify behavior on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
