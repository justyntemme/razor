* Razor File Explorer Implementation Strategy

** Core Architecture & Philosophy
   - [X] *Event Driven Architecture*: 
     - [X] Use unbuffered or buffered channels for all File I/O.
     - [X] Ensure the UI thread (Main Goroutine) never waits on a blocking operation.
     - [X] Implement a central event loop that `select`s on UI events and Data channels.
   - [X] *Performance First*: 
     - [X] Usage of `github.com/charlievieth/fastwalk` for rapid directory enumeration.
     - [X] Zero-allocation logic where possible in hot paths (rendering loops).
   - [X] *Project Structure*:
     - [X] Use `internal/` to encapsulate core logic.
     - [X] Example: `cmd/razor` (entry), `internal/ui` (widgets), `internal/fs` (file ops).

** Phase 1: Core Skeleton & Event Loop
   - [X] Initialize Go Workspace and Modules.
   - [X] Setup `internal/ui` package for Gio-specific code.
   - [X] Setup `internal/fs` package for `fastwalk` integration.
   - [X] Implement the main Event Loop (Channel Select Pattern).
   - [X] Verify `fastwalk` runs in a separate goroutine and pipes data back to UI.

** Phase 2: Navigation & State Management
   - [ ] Create `AppState` struct to hold `CurrentPath`, `History`, and `Selection`.
   - [X] Basic Directory Navigation (Double Click to Enter).
   - [ ] Implement `Breadcrumbs` widget for path navigation.
   - [ ] Implement History Stack (Back/Forward functionality).
   - [ ] *OS Handling*: 
     - [ ] Windows Drive enumeration (C:\, D:\).
     - [ ] Unix/Linux Root (/).

** Phase 3: High-Performance UI Rendering
   - [X] Implement Virtualization for the File List (`layout.List`).
   - [ ] Efficient Icon Rendering (Cache commonly used icons).
   - [ ] Mouse/Keyboard Interaction:
     - [ ] Single click to select (highlight).
     - [X] Double click to traverse/open.
     - [ ] Keyboard navigation (Arrow keys).

** Phase 4: Advanced Features
   - [ ] *Search*: 
     - Multi-threaded recursive search using `fastwalk`.
   - [ ] *Async Metadata*: 
     - Calculate directory sizes on a background thread.
   - [ ] *Preview Pane*: 
     - Light-weight text/image preview.

** Phase 5: Optimization & Hardening
   - [ ] *Profiling*: Use `pprof`.
   - [ ] *Context Cancellation*.
   - [ ] *Cross-Platform Checks*.
