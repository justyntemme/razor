#+TITLE: Razor 1.0 Release Checklist
#+AUTHOR: Razor Team
#+DATE: 2024

* 1.0 Release Blockers
** TODO allow modification to file list view preset (list, grid...)
** TODO External Drag and Drop Support
   :PROPERTIES:
   :PRIORITY: A
   :END:

   Support for dragging files from outside the application (Finder, Explorer, etc.) into Razor.

*** Implementation Reference
    - Gio PR: https://github.com/gioui/gio/pull/111
    - Status: PR still open, macOS implementation exists but Windows/Linux pending

*** Technical Details
    - Uses Gio's =io/transfer= package
    - Register drop targets with =transfer.TargetOp= and desired MIME type
    - Receive =transfer.DataEvent= with MIME type and =Open()= function for file access
    - Each dropped file generates individual event
    - macOS implementation in =app/os_macos.go= and =app/os_macos.m=

*** Tasks
    - [ ] Wait for Gio PR to be merged or implement using fork
    - [ ] Implement drop target registration in main file list area
    - [ ] Handle =transfer.DataEvent= to copy/move files to current directory
    - [ ] Add visual feedback during drag hover
    - [ ] Test on macOS, Windows, Linux

*** Notes
    - May need to use a Gio fork if PR is not merged
    - Consider filename/URL metadata needs (discussed in PR)
    - Multiple file drops generate separate events per file

** DONE Size Column Display Bug
   :PROPERTIES:
   :PRIORITY: B
   :END:

   Size column text gets cut off when displaying values like "MB" or larger units.

*** Symptoms
    - File size display truncates unit suffix (e.g., "1.2 M" instead of "1.2 MB")
    - Column width may not be adequate for larger size values

*** Resolution
    - Increased minimum size column width from 50px to 70px to fit "999.9 GB"
    - File: internal/ui/renderer_rows.go:118-120
