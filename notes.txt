add a start shell here right click command on folders, and in the whitespace of a directorh (cwd for path) and path in the selected folder as the path argment to login shell value

tab opens (in same directory, in home directory) = make hotkeys for both, cmd t = one and cmd shift t equals the other, but enable them to be confiruable
add the draggable window element to the header entries (name, date modified... etc)
delete confirmation doesnt use edpanded modal window (we should also not just expand entirely but look to center the window with a shadow behind it)
round modal edges and add shadows to make it look cleaner
write an orgmode parser that just creates the AST from the doc and not html

add org support
maybe increase limit for double click 
⏺ Gio Workarounds Applied

  1. key.NameInsert not defined - Gio doesn't export this constant. Workaround: use key.Name("Insert") as a string-based key name
  (internal/config/hotkeys.go:112).
  2. Editor has no Focus() method - Can't programmatically focus a widget.Editor. Workaround: set a flag (searchEditorFocused), then issue
  gtx.Execute(key.FocusCmd{Tag: &r.searchEditor}) during the next layout pass.
  3. PassOp for background click detection - Coordinate-based bounds checking failed due to nested transformation stacks. Workaround: trust Gio's event
  consumption pattern - any right-click reaching the global handler after row processing is on empty space.
  4. Global mouse position tracking - Pointer positions are relative to current clip area, not window. Workaround: capture mouse position at top-level
  layout before any transformations apply.
